# Customer-Personality-Analysis
Any  organization,  whether  small  or  big,  relies  on  its  customers  for  growth. Customers  have 
different needs and wants. Rather than treating all customers using the same marketing strategy, 
dividing  the  entire  customer  base  into  smaller,  more  manageable  segments  for  better  brand 
planning and targeted marketing is a more effective and cost-saving way to optimize its resources 
and create bigger values. 
 
In  this  project,  we  attempt  to  segment  our  customers  based  on  certain  criteria  such  as  Income, 
Marriage Status, and Kids. We will use two clustering techniques, K-Mean and K-Prototypes to 
cluster these groups of customers into smaller segments with similar features. And further using 
association Rule to answer which products leads to buying of other product.
